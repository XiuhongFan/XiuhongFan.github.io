# 💡 About Me

I have an academic background that combines **biochemistry**, **statistics**, and **data science** — allowing me to approach biomedical questions from both experimental and computational perspectives.  
My curiosity for quantitative problem-solving began in the lab and has evolved toward developing reproducible, data-driven approaches to public health research.

At Columbia, I focus on **statistical genetics**, **survival analysis**, and **advanced biostatistical modeling**.  
I aim to contribute to interdisciplinary projects that connect **biomedical data**, **population health**, and **data visualization**.
